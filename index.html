        <p> Hi Everyone,
            Hi, I'm Luci! I have a passion for technology and systems analysis, which I developed through my studies and
            hands-on projects. Currently, I'm focused on exploring dashboards in powerful tools like Power BI, helping
            businesses make data-driven decisions. This webpage serves as a hub where I share my insights, projects, and
            professional journey. Whether you're here to collaborate, connect, or simply learn more about my work, I'd
            love to hear from you!
            I'm super excited about this class and
            I hope to learn and develop news skils with all of you!

        <P>Utah is a western U.S. state known for its stunning natural landscapes, including the red rock formations of

            Mountains. Home to Salt Lake City, the state blends outdoor adventure with a growing tech industry, often
            referred to as the "Silicon Slopes." Rich in history and culture, Utah is also known for its strong pioneer
            heritage and vibrant communities.</P>
